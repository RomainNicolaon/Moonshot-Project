# 1. What problem is my moonshot project solving ?

My moonshot project is solving the problem of "How to make a videp game using an artificial intelligence to invent a good story ?".

The goal of my project is to make a video game using an artificial intelligence to invent a good story, after that I will check if it is a good story and implement it in my video game.
At the end of the project, I will publish my video game and I will share my AI to other poeple and they can use it to improve their video games.

# 2. Why do I think this problem is worth solving ?

Of course, I am not a video game developer yet, but in additiopn to be a programmer, I am a video game player and I think some stories of some video games are very repetitives and boring. So I decided to make a project to solve this problem.

# 3. How am I going to solve that problem ?

In first step, I will learn how to make an AI during my studies at @algosup, after that I will make my AI and teach it to make a good, interesting and exciting video game story.

After that, I will make a video game using my AI and publish it.
